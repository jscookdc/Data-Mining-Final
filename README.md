# Data-Mining-Final

This project was the code I used for my final project in CSC373: Data Mining at Wake Forest University in the Fall 2022 semester. This code represents a culmination of a semester of learning data mining and machine learning techniques.

Over the course of the semester, we explored a number of topics, including classification, clustering, anomaly detection, and more. Each of these units required both creating these techniques from scratch and implementing existing libraries. This final project opts to do the latter, utilizing libraries to implement many data mining techniques on the same dataset I used in my Data Science final project.

A further data exploration can be found in the Python notebook itself. This notebook is more of a showcase of my ability to implement code, not necessarily analyzing the output of said code.
